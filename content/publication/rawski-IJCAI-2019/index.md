abstract: This paper provides a geometric characterization of subclasses of the regular languages. We use finite model theory to characterize objects like strings and trees as relational structures. Logical statements meeting certain criteria over these models define subregular classes of languages. The semantics of such statements can be compiled into tensor structures, using multilinear maps as function application for evaluation. This method is applied to consider two properly subregular languages over different string models.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: I provide a vector space characterization of the Star-Free and Locally Threshold testable classes of formal languages, over arbitrary data structures.
