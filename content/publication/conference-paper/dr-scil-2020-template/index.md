abstract: This paper presents an automata-theoretic characterization of templatic morphology. We generalize the Input Strictly Local class of functions, which characterize a majority of concatenative morphology, to consider multiple lexical inputs. We show that strictly local asynchronous multi-tape transducers successfully capture this typology of nonconcatenative template filling. This characterization and restriction uniquely opens up representational issues in morphological computation.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We provide an automata-theoretic characterization of templatic morphology, extending strict locality to consider n-ary functions.
