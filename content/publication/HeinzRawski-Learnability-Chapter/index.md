abstract: This chapter examines the brief but vibrant history of learnability in phonology. We trace the question of learnability back to the foundational crises in mathematics and computer science, through the synthesis of these fields with linguistics, and onward to the foundational problems of language, and phonological, learning. We observe this history is mostly one-sided, with many ideas from learning imported to phonology, but rarely the converse. We finish by discussing several overarching tensions pervading this field, signaling rapid change and many flowering prospects.
