abstract: We explore the generative capacity of morphological theories of reduplication. We computationally classify theories of reduplication using a hierarchy of string-to-string function classes. Reduplication as a process requires only the regular class of functions. We show that various morphological theories necessarily treat it as a more expressive polyregular function, while others maintain regularity. We discuss the significance of this formal result for reduplicative functions and recognition. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We show a mismatch between the generative capacity of reduplication and the theories which model it.
